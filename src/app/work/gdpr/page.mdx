## Overview

The **GDPR** (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) gives every individual in the European Union enforceable rights over their personal data and applies **extraterritorially** to any organisation that touches that data.  
Non-compliance can mean fines of up to 4 % of worldwide turnover—plus injunctions that stop launches in their tracks.

Our specialists make sure that never happens to you:

- Map data flows and produce Article 30 records in days, not months.
- Bake privacy-by-design into each sprint through ready-made user-story templates.
- Run DPIAs with templated risk libraries and automated mitigation tracking.
- Draft and negotiate Data-Processing Agreements (DPAs) and UK/EU SCC bundles.
- Build DSAR and deletion workflows that stay under the one-month statutory clock.
- Perform Schrems II Transfer-Impact Assessments and design fallback measures.
- Train engineers and product owners so compliance sticks long after the project ends.

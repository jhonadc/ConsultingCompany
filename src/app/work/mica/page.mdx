## Overview

**MiCA** (Regulation (EU) 2023/1114) is the first comprehensive crypto framework of any major jurisdiction.  
It introduces:

- **Issuer obligations** for Asset-Referenced Tokens (ARTs) and E-Money Tokens (EMTs), including capital, reserve and disclosure rules.
- A single **Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP)** licence that replaces fragmented national regimes—passportable across the entire EU.
- **Market-abuse**, **insider-dealing** and **pump-and-dump** prohibitions mirroring MAR/MiFID.
- Mandatory **white-paper** publication for public offerings and exchange listings.
- Built-in alignment with the EU’s AML package (AMLR/AMLD 6) and TFR (Travel Rule).

Our MiCA practice turns those articles into executable workstreams:

1. **Token classification & gap analysis** – identify whether your asset is an ART, EMT or ‘other’ crypto-asset and map resulting obligations.
2. **White-paper drafting & translation** – generate MiCA-compliant disclosure docs plus legal-language translations for all EU-27.
3. **CASP authorisation dossier** – policies, financial-crime framework, governance chart and ICT-risk templates ready for your national competent authority.
4. **Reserve-asset & audit set-up** – design safeguarding structures, attestations and real-time reserve monitoring for stablecoins.
5. **AML/KYC & Travel-Rule tech** – integrate chain-analytics and VASP-messaging to keep supervisors and counterparties happy.
6. **Board & developer training** – half-day workshops that convert regulatory text into engineering tasks and executive KPIs.
